        Generates 22 features from Thornton, PhD Thesis, Univ. Manchester, 2013.
        
        Features:
        
        Computes the sinusoid fitting features for the profile data. There are four features computed:
        
        Feature 1. Chi-Squared value for sine fit to raw profile. This attempts to fit a sine curve
                 to the pulse profile. The reason for doing this is that many forms of RFI are sinusoidal.
                 Thus the chi-squared value for such a fit should be low for RFI (indicating
                 a close fit) and high for a signal of interest (indicating a poor fit).
                 
        Feature 2. Chi-Squared value for sine-squared fit to amended profile. This attempts to fit a sine
                 squared curve to the pulse profile, on the understanding that a sine-squared curve is similar
                 to legitimate pulsar emission. Thus the chi-squared value for such a fit should be low for
                 RFI (indicating a close fit) and high for a signal of interest (indicating a poor fit).
                 
        Feature 3. Difference between maxima. This is the number of peaks the program identifies in the pulse
                 profile - 1. Too high a value may indicate that a candidate is caused by RFI. If there is only
                 one pulse in the profile this value should be zero.
                 
        Feature 4. Sum over residuals.  Given a pulse profile represented by an array of profile intensities P,
                 the sum over residuals subtracts ( (max-min) /2) from each value in P. A larger sum generally
                 means a higher SNR and hence other features will also be stronger, such as correlation between
                 sub-bands. Example,
                 
                 P = [ 10 , 13 , 17 , 50 , 20 , 10 , 5 ]
                 max = 50
                 min = 5
                 (abs(max-min))/2 = 22.5
                 so the sum over residuals is:
                 
                  = (22.5 - 10) + (22.5 - 13) + (22.5 - 17) + (22.5 - 50) + (22.5 - 20) + (22.5 - 10) + (22.5 - 5)
                  = 12.5 + 9.5 + 5.5 + (-27.5) + 2.5 + 12.5 + 17.5
                  = 32.5
        
        Computes the Gaussian fitting features for the profile data. There are seven features computed:
        
        Feature 5. Distance between expectation values of Gaussian and fixed Gaussian fits to profile histogram.
                 This fits a two Gaussian curves to a histogram of the profile data. One of these
                 Gaussian fits has its mean value set to the value in the centre bin of the histogram,
                 the other is not constrained. Thus it is expected that for a candidate arising from noise,
                 these two fits will be very similar - the distance between them will be zero. However a
                 legitimate signal should be different giving rise to a higher feature value.
                 
        Feature 6. Ratio of the maximum values of Gaussian and fixed Gaussian fits to profile histogram.
                 This computes the maximum height of the fixed Gaussian curve (mean fixed to the centre
                 bin) to the profile histogram, and the maximum height of the non-fixed Gaussian curve
                 to the profile histogram. This ratio will be equal to 1 for perfect noise, or close to zero
                 for legitimate pulsar emission.
        
        Feature 7. Distance between expectation values of derivative histogram and profile histogram. A histogram
                 of profile derivatives is computed. This finds the absolute value of the mean of the 
                 derivative histogram, minus the mean of the profile histogram. A value close to zero indicates 
                 a candidate arising from noise, a value greater than zero some form of legitimate signal.
        
        Feature 8. Full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) of Gaussian fit to pulse profile. Describes the width of the
                 pulse, i.e. the width of the Gaussian fit of the pulse profile. Equal to 2*sqrt( 2 ln(2) )*sigma.
                 Not clear whether a higher or lower value is desirable.
        
        Feature 9. Chi squared value from Gaussian fit to pulse profile. Lower values are indicators of a close fit,
                 and a possible profile source.
        
        Feature 10. Smallest FWHM of double-Gaussian fit to pulse profile. Some pulsars have a doubly peaked
                  profile. This fits two Gaussians to the pulse profile, then computes the FWHM of this
                  double Gaussian fit. Not clear if higher or lower values are desired.
        
        Feature 11. Chi squared value from double Gaussian fit to pulse profile. Smaller values are indicators
                  of a close fit and possible pulsar source.
        
        Computes the candidate parameters. There are four features computed:
        
        Feature 12. The candidate period.
                 
        Feature 13. The best signal-to-noise value obtained for the candidate. Higher values desired.
        
        Feature 14. The best dispersion measure (dm) obtained for the candidate. Low DM values 
                  are assocaited with local RFI.
                 
        Feature 15. The best pulse width.
        
        Computes the dispersion measure curve fitting parameters:
        
        Feature 16. This feature computes SNR / SQRT( (P-W) / W ).
                 
        Feature 17. Difference between fitting factor Prop, and 1. If the candidate is a pulsar,
                  then prop should be equal to 1.
        
        Feature 18. Difference between best DM value and optimised DM value from fit. This difference
                  should be small for a legitimate pulsar signal. 
                 
        Feature 19. Chi squared value from DM curve fit, smaller values indicate a smaller fit. Thus
                  smaller values will be possessed by legitimate signals.
        
         Computes the sub-band features:
        
        Feature 20. RMS of peak positions in all sub-bands. Smaller values should be possessed by
                  legitimate pulsar signals.
                 
        Feature 21. Average correlation coefficient for each pair of sub-bands. Larger values should be
                  possessed by legitimate pulsar signals.
        
        Feature 22. Sum of correlation coefficients between sub-bands and profile. Larger values should be
                  possessed by legitimate pulsar signals.
                                                
        Parameters:
        N/A
        
        Returns:
        An array of 22 candidate features as floating point values.
