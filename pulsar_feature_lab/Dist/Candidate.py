        Calculates the features for this candidate. If the file name of
        this Candidate object contains .pfd, then the PFD file feature generation
        code should be executed. Likewise if the file name ends in PHCX, then
        PHCX file feature generation (either for Thornton gnuzipped '.phcx.gz' PHCX files, or
        Morello et al. PHCX files) should be executed. 
        
        Note that there is a subtle difference between the PHCX files used by Thornton
        and Morello et al. - in terms of where the profile data is stored in XML format. 
        Thus these files should be treated differently. For Thornton generated PHCX files,
        the xml data contains two distinct profile sections:
        
            i.e. there are two <Profile>...</Profile>  sections in the file.
        
        These section are indexed by the code that reads the xml. The first section
        with profileIndex = 0, corresponds to a profile obtained after the FFT.
        The second, profileIndex = 1, to a profile that has been period and DM searched
        using PDMPD. Since the latter is the correct data to use for Thronton produced
        PHCX files, we use the data at profileIndex = 1.
        
        For Morello et al. produced data, there is a similar situation, except that the data
        sections are in reverse order. So now we need to use profileIndex = 0 to get the profile
        data that has been period and DM searched using PDMPD. 
        
        The result of this is that the two types of PHCX file are treated slightly differently.
        
        If further data file formats need to be processed, then changes need
        to be made here in order to cope with them. For example, if a new file format
        called .x appears, then below a check must be added for .x files,
        along with a new script to deal with them. Also note that additional changes
        would also be needed for the PulsarFeatureLab.py command line argument processing
        code, and a slight modification to the process() function in the FeatureGenerator.py
        script.
